## Game Logic Pseudo-code
```
IF clickedSquare IS NONE:
	SET clickedSquare.content AS currentTurn

		ADD score TO currentTurn
		END
	
	IF grid DOESN'T CONTAIN NONE:
		ADD score TO draw
		END
	
	TOGGLE currentTurn
```

## Tools
- **JavaScript**: The easiest programming language for web applications.
- **Webpack**: Managing multiple JavaScript files.
- **Prettier**: Code formatting.
- **ESLint**: Code consistency.

## Challenges
- Would it be optimal to hard-code the winning cases, or is there a way to determinate dynamically?

## Takeaways
### Observable Design Pattern

### Object-Oriented Programming
